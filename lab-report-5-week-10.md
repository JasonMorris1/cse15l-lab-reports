# Lab Report 5 

## Test  1 with different results
[Link to test file](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/201.md)
Using vimdiff, I found that my implementation produced a different output for test file 201.md than the markdown implementation provided in lab 9. My implementation found no links where as the provided implementation found `baz` as a link in the file.

Copying the contents of 201.md into Commommark.js website we can see what the correct output should be:

As seen in the box on the right hand side the expected output has no links therefore my implementations was correct and the provided implementation has a bug. 

To fix the provided implementation we could add code that checks if the next character after the close bracket "]" is the open parenthesis character "(". To do this we could check if `openParen - nextCloseBracket = 1 ` and if this is not the case we don't consider this a valid link. By trying different input in Common Mark I found that any charters between [] and () cause the link to be invalid.

## Test File 2
[TestFile Link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/22.md)



Test file 22 which contains ` [foo](/bar\* "ti\*tle") ` produced a different result for my implementation which can be seen on the left side ov vimmdiff and the provided implementation on the right side.

### Expected output

Since the expected output is a link my implementation provided the correct result, and the provided implementation output contained no SSSS
